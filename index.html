            This paper presents the fact i dont know howt to code or spell or type buth thankfully this is just a place holder text to see if everything works and also to see if i need to 
            manualy input enters in my text or it will automatically do it when i run out of room... turns out i have to manulayy do it with spacing on left and right with 'space' and 
            enters at the end of the line so the text doesnt go off the page!

            Since entering Formula 1 in 1966, McLaren has grown from a small constructor founded by Bruce McLaren into one of the sport’s most successful and technologically influential 
            teams. Throughout its history, McLaren has repeatedly introduced engineering innovations that have reshaped Formula 1 design principles, including the first carbon-fibre 
            monocoque and some of the most aerodynamically refined cars of their eras (Hilton, 2019). This essay examines the evolution of McLaren’s car development across five key phases,
            highlighting how regulation, technology, and organisational advancements have shaped the team’s engineering direction (Hilton, 2014).

            McLaren’s first car, the M2B (as shown above), was notable for its use of Mallite, a lightweight balsa-aluminium composite. Although the material proved difficult to work with, its use demonstrated the 
            team’s readiness to explore alternatives beyond conventional aluminium monocoques (McLaren, 2023). During the early 1970s McLaren refined its aerodynamic understanding. The M7C and later the M19 
            incorporated increasingly sophisticated wing structures as the team responded to the aerodynamic arms race that was reshaping Formula 1 (Henry, 2013). The breakthrough came with the M23, introduced in 
            1973. This chassis combined aerodynamic stability, strong packaging around the Cosworth DFV engine, and reliability, enabling McLaren to secure their first Drivers’ and Constructors’ Championships in 
            1974 (Saward, 2017). The M23’s longevity meant it remained competitive for several season illustrated McLaren’s growing mastery of mechanical and aerodynamic harmony.

            wait so for the reference using a url can it be put in the midle of my text by <a href="https://www.google.com">link text</a> or will this not work and just display the code as is. time
            to seeeeeeeee. so the problem with link text is that it very condenses the url so harder to work out spacing of my text if i use it but managable
